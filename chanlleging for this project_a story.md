The "Do-It-Yourself (D.I.Y.) Smart Home" project is my favorite and also the most challenging one for me. 

This project aims to help mild Alzheimer's people to do daily tasks independently. It includes goal recognition and tracking algorithm design and user interface development.  Knowledge base for daily activities which specify hierarchical and ordered relations of tasks is essential for goal recognition.   

The roadblock for me is how to obtain sufficient but customized knowledge base for specific users. My solution is to ask caregivers themselves to define the personalized knowledge base according to their own home environment. 

In order to achieve this, firstly, I designed a knowledge base format for the goal recognition algorithm. Secondly, I designed the caregiver user interface where users can specify the knowledge base by dragging objects and simple inputs (just like drawing a diagram). Lastly, I implement a series of logic to convert users' operations to the predefined knowledge format. 

By using this method, care givers can define their personalized knowledge base according the specific problems of the patient. So the performance of the system is improved.
